# flights

With this project, we set out to create a travel application where users can shop for flights, as well as plan what they will need for their trip all on one platform. 

To begin, users are asked to create a profile where their purchased and "wish-list" flights will be stored. They can then begin looking for the best flights to suit their needs. Once a flight is "purchased" users can begin planning what they will bring with them. 

This project was begun before we saw massive effects from the COVID-19 pandemic, which created more than a few challenges to get it deployed. Since air travel essentially came to a hault, we were unable to obtain data from a reliable API. To overcome this, we hard-coded flight data into our database. For a second version, we would include more extensive flight options for our users. 

Further development opportunities would be to include the ability to book cars and hotel packages from the same platform. This would give our users the option of designing a trip from start to finish with us.
